						<h2>about brassy</h2>
						<p>Women routinely have their lives described to them, their identities
						handed to them in a package topped with a bow strangling their sense of self. Brassy is a project that seeks to unpack what womanhood means for female identifying folks and empower women to claim their agency care for their true selves.</p>
						<p>Built on the foundation of my original book, this expansion brings the ideas of self-discovery and deep dives into womanhood into a public sphere. Through this project, others will be able to interact with not only that project but also the ideas and conversations it brings up around womanhood, agency, modern society, self-discovery, and feminism. Brassy will now be more than a single book, it will be a state of mind and a movement. The website will act as home base for content created for and by “brassy women” from all over. I will initiate this by showcasing some of my content from the original project as well as create and curate additional pieces. This will include short videos and motion graphics, essays and visual assets, a “book club” of resources, Spotify playlists, accounts to follow, and more. It will also allow individuals to engage offline by purchasing a workbook and doing more intensive self-discovery.</p>

						<h3>creating a community</h3>
						<p>brassy was created to be a platform for women to hear each other’s stories, explore their identity as a woman, to reflect on the role of women in society, and celebrate our strength and collective power. brassy is dedicated to the care and keeping of all women, regardless of race, anatomy, sexuality, class, geography, or any factors used to divide us. The issues one woman faces is an issue for all women to tackle together. brassy is a community to allow for that kind of collaboration, support, and celebration.</p>

	<h3>brassy: an exhibition</h3>
	<p>My own journey unpacking womanhood in my life started in 2015 with my post-baccalaureate certificate final project. I filled an “exhibit catalogue” with illustrators, essays, poems, photography, and mixed media pieces as if they were part of a real exhibition of my life on display. For two years, I asked hard questions, recognized truths that were not always kind, and learned self-compassion beyond anything an inspirational quote could provide. Perhaps most importantly, I gave myself a language for talking about my experiences as a woman and as a human being. It is this original project that became the framework for my capstone. I wanted to empower other women to explore themselves and to create a community ready to support each other through that journey and beyond.</p>

						<h3>the making of brassy</h3>
						<p>In expanding my original project from a personal exploration to something much larger and public, I realized I needed additional perspectives in order to create the accessible and welcoming community I envisioned. My research led me to surveying women, asking what they considered to be important contributing factors to their identity as women; I read several books and articles about womanhood, feminism, and intersectional work; and I researched workbooks and sourced information from my network about who would be impactful and who could make a difference when women started their own journey through brassy.</p>
						<p>Beyond the ideation process, this research, and my conversations with
						women, I worked to form a graphic identity that allowed for flexibility and that created a space where all kinds of women would feel welcome. I also drew up grounding principles that informed my writing, content curation, and workbook. To promote the project, I also developed a social media strategy and invested time in cultivating an Instagram presence.</p>
						<p>Finally, I realized my own voice and by extension my own work, would not and should not speak for all women’s experiences. No matter how welcoming of a space I created, I was never going to be able to provide an authentic experience if I did not start including other voices immediately. To ensure that other perspectives were part of my project, I contacted women in my network to be contributors to this first quarter of brassy. Illustrators, writers, organizers, and other women all with meaningful stores, submitted pieces that spoke to their own experiences in womanhood. Not all of these submissions seem outwardly about life as a woman, but if I learned anything from unpacking my own identity, it is that women are far more than any definitions presented to us by society.</p>

							<p>A former art history major turned communications and marketing maven, I've been known to get weak in the knees in front of old masters, good branding, and the occasional Instagram post. Made of equal parts pragmatism and sass, I take pride in being a mission-based designer and strive to tell meaningful stories through beautiful design. I truly want to create things that make a positive impact on others and the greater community, all while injecting the world with a bit of fun.</p>
